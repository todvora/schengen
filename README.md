# Temporary Reintroduction of Border Control
This repository provides parsed and cleaned list of the temporary reintroduction of border control as published on [Temporary Reintroduction of Border Control](https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/policies/schengen-borders-and-visa/schengen-area/temporary-reintroduction-border-control_en)

This page provides all the entries in one PDF file. This file is hard to parse, doesn't use any standardized format for dates and is impossible to copy&paste for further processing.

I gave it a while, extracted and manually corrected the data, standardized date formats, merged descriptions, added _duration_ column to visualy verify if the parsed dates make sense. It's *very* likely that the published CSV contains errors and mistakes. Please don't realy on it! Verify it for yourself.
